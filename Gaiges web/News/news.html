                <p>
                    Lets start first off by this channel is not something you can spam in, your IP will be banned (plus
                    its
                    impossible.)<br>
                    Second some of this stuff might be offensive, all I do is just put it up, I don't have any rules to
                    follow other than if I think its offensive its probably really offensive.<br>
                    If you find any of the things on this channel here is a list of things you can do.
                <ol>

                    <li>Leave</li>
                    <li>Last but not least, leave.</li>
                </ol>
                Have a great time here!

            <span id="heading">Don't let the teachers know about this website!
                <p>There is a website called <a href="https://3kho.github.io">3kho.github.io</a>. Its like UBG100 but
                    with more stuff and its unblocked still.
                    You can play games, chat with friends, almost anything fun that you can think of. Don't tell the
                    teachers about my website either, because they
                    will see this and then they will report it to whoever is in charge up there and then it will be
                    blocked.</p>
                    <p>Now, lets talk about somethings included with 3kho. There are tons of games like I said before, way more than ubg100, some of those games include, Sam Hogan's Cell machine, Tunnel rush, Super Mario 64, etc. My personal favorite is probably "Santy's home," a horror game. This is my go to website for gaming, now that UBG100 is gone.</p>
